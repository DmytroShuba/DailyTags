# DailyTags: markdown library with support of custom tags
DailyTags converts a given markup into rich text for Jetpack Compose. It comes with Markdown and HTML support by default (please, see list of supported features) and is very easy to extend to support custom markups.

The library parses text source into nodes which are then styled using [AnnotatedString](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/text/AnnotatedString). No WebView is required. All you need is to create a rule that defines how the text is extracted and styled. More examples below!

DailyTags aims to be:
- ‚ö° fast
- ü™∂ lightweight
- üëã easy to use
- üèóÔ∏è extensible

The library provides defaults to display Markdown content along with giving all the means to tweak the appearance as much as you wish!This repository contains DailyTags source code and a sample app.


## üì¶ Installation
Add the following configuration to the `build.gradle` files:
```groovy
allprojects {
   repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
   }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.dmytroshuba:dailytags:1.0.0'
}
```

## üî® Usage
### Markdown
DailyTags supports most of the Markdown features, but not all ([the list of supported features]()).

To parse Markdown content use SimpleMarkupParser and MarkdownRules together:
```kotlin
    val source = "<b>Hello world</b>"
    val rules = MarkdownRules.toList()
    val parser = SimpleMarkupParser()
    val content = parser
        .parse(source, rules)
        .render()
        .toAnnotatedString()

    Text(text = content)
```

### Markdown and HTML
```kotlin
    val source = "<b>Hello world</b>"
    val rules = MarkdownRules.toList() + HtmlRules.toList()
    val parser = SimpleMarkupParser()
    val content = parser
        .parse(source, rules)
        .render()
        .toAnnotatedString()

    Text(text = content)
```

### Custom tags
Let's create a tag for highlighting text with blue color. First, create a pattern with a regular expression to find the specified content:
```kotlin
val PATTERN_HIGHLIGHT_BLUE = Pattern("^<hl-blue>([\s\S]+?)<\/hl-blue>")
```
Now create a rule with it which will content the pattern and styling configuration for the matched content:
```kotlin
val blueRule = PATTERN_HIGHLIGHT_BLUE.toRule(spanStyles = SpanStyle(color = Color.Blue))
```
Then simply add your rule when parsing the content:

```kotlin
    val parser = SimpleMarkupParser()
    val rules = listOf(blueRule, ...)
    val content = parser
       .parse(source, rules)
       .render()
       .toAnnotatedString()
```
